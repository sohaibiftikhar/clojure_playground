## Learnings
* Maps can be passed multiple maps  
  ```
  (map str ["a" "b" "c"] ["A" "B" "C"])
  ; => ("aA" "bB" "cC")
  ```
* Popular sequence functions: map reduce take-while drop-while filter some count concat
* Some return value instead of true:
  ```$xslt
  (some #(and (> (:critter %) 3) %) food-journal)
  ```
* vim-fireplace shortcuts:
  * gf = jump to namespace under cursor (goto file)
  * cpr and :Require! - (require :reload) or (require reload-all)
  * `Eval (clojure code)` - evaluate arbitratry clojure code
  * `cqp` - open quasi REPL
  * `cpp` - execute current block
  * `:lopen` open stacktracce for last error
  * `C-x C-o` for omni-complete `C-n C-p` also work fine.
  * `Shift-k` for getting documentation
  * `:Doc ` for looking up documentation for symbol
  * `[d` display the source for the symbol under cursor
  * `:Source ` display source for symbol entered in prompt
  * `[C-D` jumps to the definition of a symbol
  * `:RunTests` kicks of `(clojure.test/run-tests)` and loads results into quickfix
  *
